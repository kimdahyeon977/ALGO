## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to our Awesome Algorithm Study repository! This is a collaborative space where we solve algorithmic problems, enhance our understanding of data structures, and grow together as programmers.

## 🌟 Participants

## 🎯 Study Objectives

The primary goals of this study include:

- Improving understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Enhancing programming skills through weekly problem-solving.
- Providing constructive feedback through code reviews.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Solve the weekly problems individually.
2. Upload your solution to your branch in this repository.
3. Create a Pull Request for code reviews and feedback.

## 📅 Weekly Schedule

We select 4 problems based on https://github.com/encrypted-def/basic-algo-lecture/blob/master/workbook.md
and meet with every Sunday 10 p.m on discord channel.

## 📚 Problem Sources

We explore problems from various online judges. You can find the list of problems and their sources in each week's README.

## 🤝 Guidelines

- Use meaningful variable names and add comments for clarity.
- Experiment with different algorithms and data structures.
- Engage actively in code reviews, providing constructive feedback.

## 🚦 Progress

Track our study's progress through the [weekly summaries](weekly/README.md).
